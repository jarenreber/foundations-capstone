# Gila Outdoors,

## A Mountain Bike Trail Tracker

### About

Gila outdoors was a capstone project that was done for Devmountain's foundation course for Web Development. The project is built with vanilla Javascript and a plethora of other tools.

### To Run the Project

This project depends on an api built into the Rapid Api system named the TrailAPI. https://rapidapi.com/trailapi/api/trailapi/
Therefore, to run this project you will need to create an account with RapidAPI and sign up for the TrailAPI. This will give you a api key that you can then either paste into the necessary files or create a config.js file at the root of the project and export a constant variable with the api key as the value. Lastly you will need to run a node package manager to install the necessary dependencies.
